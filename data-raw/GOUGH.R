# I have attached processed data from a GLS tag deployed on a Grey
# Petrel from Gough Island. The data belongs to Ben Dilley and Prof
# Peter Ryan from the Percy Fitzpatrick Institute for Ornithology at
# UCT. They have passed it on to me for further analysis but are happy
# for it to be featured on SGAT. I have edited the code to account for
# the nuances of Greys, but can standardise it if you need. I chose this
# one as the equinox period isn't catastrophic. The equinox issue seems
# a little worse for these guys than for the albies, shearwaters, ellies
# and furries...perhaps the more northerly latitude? I also have a
# couple with particularly bad light data if you need something of that
# flavour...
